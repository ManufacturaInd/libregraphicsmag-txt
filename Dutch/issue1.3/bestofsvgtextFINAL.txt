Isn't Open Clip Art Library handy?

The expression "many hands make light work" uses the analogy of the hand to represent participation or involvement. As we talk about collaboration, it seems appropriate, this time around, to look a little more literally at the symbol used so often to represent work.

This issue, Best of SVG scoured the revamped Open Clip Art Library, looking for the best hands on offer. As it turns out, OCAL provides hands for all occasions. 

If you haven't already used or contributed to Open Clip Art Library, take a look now. All work there is in SVG format and is dedicated to the public domain. That means you can use it for just about anything. Check it out, use it and add a little work of your own. Find it at openclipart.org
