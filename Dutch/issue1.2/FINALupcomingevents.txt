UPCOMING EVENTS

We're very pleased to present a calendar of upcoming events which encompass all things graphic design, media art and F/LOSS. Given that there are few events which tackle all three subjects, we aim to offer you events where you can be the agent of change: the F/LOSS designer at a traditional design event, or maybe the designer at a predominantly software developer event.
