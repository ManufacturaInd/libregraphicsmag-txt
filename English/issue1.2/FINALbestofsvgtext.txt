Best of SVG

Wayfinding and warnings from Wikimedia Commons

Warning signs, street signs, all kinds of signs: they blend into our environments, letting us know what we need to know with minimal fuss. Rather, that's what they do when well designed. When badly designed, they confuse and jar us. 

This time around, Best of SVG has collected some of the finest examples of signage Wikimedia Commons has to offer. From warnings of lasers and potential explosions, to incredibly pleasing no passing signs, there's a nice assortment on offer.

We've found that warning and traffic signs are one of the strong points of the Wikimedia Commons collection of SVG graphics. Signs and heraldry. But that's a collection for another day. If you don't yet know about Wikimedia Commons, it's well worth checking out. Not only do its graphics feature in the Wikipedia articles we know and love, but it has a pretty nice collection of other media, all under permissive licenses, for your appreciation and re-use. Find it at commons.wikimedia.org.
