Best of SVG: Maps


Even blank maps can tell a history. 
Just browse the colletion of Blank World Maps offered by Wikimedia Commons and OpenStreetMap, set your eyes on the ever changing boundaries of countries and nations. 
Being SVG, they are doubly useful: one, you get resolution-independent maps, allowing you to scale them without mercy. Two, SVG makes them perfect for including in a web application or visualization, creating experimental programs around geographic data, and for clever maps that embed additional cartographic data in the file itself.
It's a journey through history in SVG shapes.
